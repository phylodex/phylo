If you are running this on the simulator, the capture mode will not work. Also, It might
be necessary to comment out line 231 in PXAppDelegate.m, below the comment "FOR DEVELOPMENT 
PURPOSES: DELETES THE STORE". Then stop the program, and re-comment it. This process 
deletes any existing data store that is in conflict with the one the app is trying to access.
